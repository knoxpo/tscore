# Engine comparison: tscore vs node (V8) vs bun (JSC)

- date: 2026-09-06 00:56
- machine: Apple M5 Max, 18 logical cpus (6P + 12E)
- tscore: tscore 0.1.0, node: v24.17.0, bun: 1.4.0
- steady-state cells: median TIME_MS of 5 runs, first run discarded; in-program warmup pass before timing
- ratios: engine_ms / node_ms — lower is better, <1.00x is faster than node
- methodology: shared benchmarks are byte-identical sources in the tscore language subset;
  node/bun run non-idiomatic code (no Array.map, classes, etc.) — this compares engines on
  identical programs, not idiomatic-per-engine programs
